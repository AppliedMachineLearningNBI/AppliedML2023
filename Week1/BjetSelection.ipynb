    "# Classification of b-quark jets in the Aleph simulated data\n",
    "\n",
    "Python macro for selecting b-jets (sprays of particles with a b-quark in it) in Aleph Z -> qqbar MC (i.e. simulated decays of the Z0 boson decaying to a quark and an anti-quark) in various ways:\n",
    "* Initially, simply with \"if\"-statements making requirements on certain variables. This corresponds to selecting \"boxes\" in the input variable space (typically called \"X\"). One could also try a Fisher discriminant (linear combination of input variables), which corresponds to a plane in the X-space. But as the problem is non-linear, it is likely to be sub-optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next using Machine Learning (ML) methods. We will during the first week try both (Boosted) Decision Tree ((B)DT) based and Neural Net (NN) based methods, and see how complicated (or not) it is to get a good solution, and how much better it performs compared to the \"classic\" selection method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you obtain a classification of b-jets vs. non-b-jets, think about how to quantify the quality of your algorithm. Also, try to compare it to the NN result of the Aleph collaboration, given by the variable \"nnbjet\". It is based on a neural network with 6 input variables (prob_b, spheri, pt2rel, multip, bqvjet, and ptlrel), and two hidden layers each with 10 nodes in. Can you do better?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, this exercise is the simple start on moving into the territory of Machine Learning analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data:\n",
    "The input variables (X) are (where Aleph uses only the first six):\n",
    "* **prob_b**: Probability of being a b-jet from the pointing of the tracks to the vertex.\n",
    "* **spheri**: Sphericity of the event, i.e. how spherical it is.\n",
    "* **pt2rel**: The transverse momentum squared of the tracks relative to the jet axis, i.e. width of the jet.\n",
    "* **multip**: Multiplicity of the jet (in a relative measure).\n",
    "* **bqvjet**: b-quark vertex of the jet, i.e. the probability of a detached vertex.\n",
    "* **ptlrel**: Transverse momentum (in GeV) of possible lepton with respect to jet axis (about 0 if no leptons).\n",
    "* energy: Measured energy of the jet in GeV. Should be 45 GeV, but fluctuates.\n",
    "* cTheta: cos(theta), i.e. the polar angle of the jet with respect to the beam axis. Note, that the detector works best in the central region (|cTheta| small) and less well in the forward regions.\n",
    "* phi:    The azimuth angle of the jet. As the detector is uniform in phi, this should not matter (much).\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable (Y) is:\n",
    "* isb:    1 if it is from a b-quark and 0, if it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, those before you (the Aleph collaboration in the mid 90'ies) produced a Neural Net (6 input variables, two hidden layers with 10 neurons in each, and 1 output varible) based classification variable, which you can compare to (and compete with?):\n",
    "* nnbjet: Value of original Aleph b-jet tagging algorithm, using only the last six variables (for reference).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "Thus, the task before you is to produce functions (non-ML and then ML algorithm), which given the input variables X provides an output variable estimate, Y_est, which is \"closest possible\" to the target variable, Y. The \"closest possible\" is left to the user to define in a _Loss Function_, which we will discuss further. In classification problems (such as this), the typical loss function to use \"Cross Entropy\", see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have results, you're welcome to continue with a Fisher Linear Discriminant, and you may also challenge yourself by considering \"v1\" of the data, which is a little less \"polished and ready\". If you also manage this, then don't hold back in applying a real ML algorithm to the problem (you can get inspiration from \"ML_MethodsDemos.ipynb\" or the vast internet). A suggestion might be XGBoost or LightGBM.\n",
